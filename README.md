# politics_cubed

## Key Concepts and goals:
The primary concept of this repository is to give people better access to political data and better tools for understanding that data.
Some of the basic goals of a Politics Cubed app include:
1) Give users the best tools to study and compare political candidates running for office. 
2) Provide users with tools to make voting safer and easier. 
3) Provide advocacy tools. 
4) Provide tools to organize new political parties, promote political concepts or parties, organize events and debates, etc.
5) Help users clarify their own political identities.
6) Provide a technological platform that users can modify and extend based on their own ideas.

For example, a common use for a user could be looking at a politicians voting record and comparing it others' records as well as the user's 
positions on issues. In that case, a user doesn't need to know how to code to harness the power of data science and machine learning. 
The user would simply enter the politician and begin looking at all the possible results and data visualizations. 

## 81 Political Sub-Groups Demonstration Code
This section outlines one possible set of data visualizations that is possible along with a link to some code written in python. 

Have you ever wondered why two people of the same political party do not align on all issues? For example, two Republicans agree on most 
issues but disagree on space colonization. Meanwhile, two Democrats agree on most issues but disagree on space colonization. In fact, on many issues, 
you can find many positions and mild to complete disagreement between members of the same political party.

The reason people do not fit nicely into one party or another is because people can have a wide variety of views. 
Politics Cubed divides the political sphere into 81 Sub-groups in a 3d space instead of a simple left, right and center on a 2d line.

Political debates often boil down politics into an either/or debate that cannot really show the wide variety of opinions that
actually exist. Politics Cubed obtains a persons beliefs on specific and general political issues and maps them to up to 
nine possible choices. It also gets a person's preferred government type and maps that as well as getting a person's basic 
political disposition(how open or closed they are to different ideas and compromises). 

With these three parameters, 81 Political Sub-groups are possible.

Hopefully, this can provide a better understanding of politics and help solve political problems, and reduce polarization.

This program written in python will demonstrate the concept:

3) Form a DAO that can ultimately assume management of Politics Cubed repository.
4) Develop new data visualizations and other ideas.
5) Make a database of issues divided into as many positions as possible per the Nine Positions Model(Left-Left, Center-Left, Right-Left,
Left-Center, Center-Center, Right-Center, Left-Right, Center-Right, Right-Right).
6) Fix typos and make content editing.
7) Investigate and integrate existing related respositories into Politics Cubed.
