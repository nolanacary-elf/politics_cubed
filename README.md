# politics_cubed
Have you ever wondered why two people of the same political party do not align on all issues? For example, two Republicans agree on most 
issues but disagree on space colonization. Meanwhile, two Democrats agree on most issues but disagree on space colonization. In fact, on many issues, 
you can find many positions and mild to complete disagreement between members of the same political party.

The reason people do not fit nicely into one party or another is because people can have a wide variety of views. 
Politics Cubed divides the political sphere into 81 Sub-groups in a 3d space instead of a simple left, right and center on a 2d line
to better reflect political opinions and beliefs.

Political debates often boil down politics into an either/or debate that cannot really show the wide variety of opinions that
actually exist. Politics Cubed obtains a persons beliefs on specific and general political issues and maps them to up to 
nine possible choices. It also gets a person's preferred government type and maps that as well as getting a person's basic 
political disposition(how open or closed they are to different ideas and compromises). 

With these three parameters, 81 Political Sub-groups are possible.

Hopefully, this can provide a better understanding of politics and general, help solve political problems, and reduce polarization.

This program written in python will demonstrate the concept:
