Politics Cubed divides the political sphere into 81 Sub-groups in a 3d space instead of a simple left, right and center on a 2d line
to better reflect political opinions and beliefs.

Political debates often boil down politics into an either/or debate that cannot really show the wide variety of opinions that
actually exist. Politics Cubed obtains a persons beliefs on specific and general political issues and maps them to up to 
nine possible choices. It also gets a person's preferred government type and maps that as well as getting a person's basic 
political disposition(how open or closed they are to different ideas and compromises). 

With these three parameters, 81 Political Sub-groups are possible.

Hopefully, this can provide a better understanding of politics and general, help solve political problems, and reduce polarization.
